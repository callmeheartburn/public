The short form is: I've always loved stories. It's been a long time since I've made one, and I'm without a doubt incredibly rusty, but I want to write again.
I don't have a plan, or anything. I just figure I'll try a couple projects and embrace being cringy, and hopefully I'll learn something in the process.
After that - well, that's future me's problem. 
Let's see where this goes. :)
